# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Objective

Analyze sales data from a CSV file using Python and Pandas, and visualize key insights using charts.

## Tools Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Files

* `sales_data.csv`: Dummy dataset containing sample sales records by region, product, and date.
* `Sales Data Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis code and visualizations.

## Features

1. **Load CSV File**: Read sales data using Pandas.
2. **Group and Summarize**: Use `groupby()` and `sum()` to calculate total sales by region.
3. **Data Visualization**: Generate a bar chart to display total sales per region.
4. **Optional**: Convert dates and analyze monthly sales trends using line plots.

## How to Run

1. Open `Sales Data Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.
2. Ensure `sales_data.csv` is in the same directory or uploaded to Colab.
3. Run all cells to see data preview, grouped results, and visual charts.

## Sample Output

* Table showing total sales by region
* Bar chart visualizing regional sales
* (Optional) Line chart of monthly sales trends
